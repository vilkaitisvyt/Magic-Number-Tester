# Magic-Number-Tester

This was an assignment to write a program to check if a number is magic or not.

A magic number is an integer in which permutations of the digits are successive 
multiples of the number (number of digits and order does not change, but can 
start from different position).

The most widely known is 142857:
142857 x 1 = 142857
142857 x 2 = 285714
142857 x 3 = 428571
142857 x 4 = 571428
142857 x 5 = 714285
142857 x 6 = 857142

Input Data:
> Input a number: 142857
Expected Output:
> It's magic!
